This can be limiting in many cases. Our model is specifically trained to extract key sentences and abstract out longer sentences and condense them into a crisp summary.\nOur summarizer works best for articles in English, but we encourage you to try other languages too.

In such a case, you can write a parser for your articles which is custom-tailored to the structure of your articles and hence no extra phrases are captured during the parsing of the text.",

The world No 4 will face Tomas Berdych or Juan Monaco in the last four. Murray believes Aljaz Bedene's arrival in the top 100 is a 'positive' thing for British tennis. The 27-year-old believes his fellow British players should use the assimilation of the world number 83, originally from Slovenia, as motivation to better themselves. Murray described Bedene as a 'good player with a very good serve'. The British No 1 is set to marry fiancee Kim Sears next week."
