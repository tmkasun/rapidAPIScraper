It automatically learns a noise profile by analyzing voice activities, and suppresses noise spectrum. Users can adjust noise reduction level to achieve a desired balance between noise reduction and speech natureness. The noise reduction API is designed for improving perceptual intelligence of noise audios in applications of audio conferencing, audio and video editing, speech therapy and couching, and etc. This is a purely software based technology, independent of recording devices or environment.",
