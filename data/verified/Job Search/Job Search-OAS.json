The project would begin in mid-May, last approximately one month, and be do-able remotely.  \\n\\nThe project will entail researching clinical decision support, population health, consumer engagement, and other healthcare applications that require access to data from patients\\u2019 EHR records.  Such 3rd-party applications, distinct from and auxiliary to EHRs themselves, are rapidly proliferating given recent advancements in standardized APIs and federal regulations that mandate the electronic sharing of clinical data with patients.  The goal of the researcher's work will be to identify and characterize such applications, whether developed in research environments or commercial settings, and to identify the relevant developers for each application who can be contacted to collect additional data during a subsequent phase of the project.  The result of the project will be a structured directory of such applications.\\n\\nDesired qualifications include some understanding of the health care system, general familiarity with techniques for health data interoperability, resourcefulness, dogged perseverance, and attention to detail.  No specific technical skills are required, other than facility with spreadsheet and desktop database software.\\n\\nCollege graduates and suitably qualified college students may apply.\\n\\nThe position will pay $65/hour and the project will require approximately 100 hours of work.  \\n\\nThank you.\"}, {\"date_posted\": \"2021-04-07T13:15:00\", \"title\": \"Part Time Courier, Court Runner, Researcher, Process Server\", \"source\": \"craigslist.com\", \"company_name\": null, \"detail_url\": \"https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/lgl/d/san-jose-part-time-courier-court-runner/7303312775.html\", \"location\": \"SF bay area / San Jose Downtown\", \"country\": \"United States\", \"state\": \"California\", \"city\": \"SF bay area\", \"description\": \"QR Code Link to This Post\\n\\n\\nThis is an part time - entry level position.\\n\\nOur office is looking for a courier to deliver court documents to the various court houses in Santa Clara County.
