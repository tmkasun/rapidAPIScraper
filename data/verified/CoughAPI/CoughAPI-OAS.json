Algorithms can also distinguish the following cough characteristics: cough intensity, cough type (dry/wet), duration, severity.\n\nREIMBURSEMENT\nMedicare and other major payers reimburse for reviewing patient-generated health data using new remote patient monitoring CPT codes.\nYou can utilize the prepared guidelines for obtaining such reimbursement\nhttp://static.coughtracker.io/rapidapi/reimbursement-guide.pdf\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThis product is not for diagnostic and is for information purposes only. Any use this product for health-related purposes is the sole responsibility of the developer.\nTo comply with the users' privacy, the algorithm recognizes only cough and its characteristics and is unable to recognize human speech or other sounds.\n\nFor Custom pricing and Features, contact the api provider.",
