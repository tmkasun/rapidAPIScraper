We can then get the left part of the pair (the parameter) and use it. Here’s how it works.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eFirst, let’s initialize our stack:\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"image-container\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"https://hackernoon.com/photos/mQU6SDxQCbfInNVd2wDklqKZtwy1-eu923za6\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIn this step, we get a fresh stack with a pair containing a parameter of type \\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003estring\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e (\\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003eworld\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e) and the storage of type \\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003estring\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e, too (\\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003eHello\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e). Our final goal is to concatenate these two strings and return them.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIn the next step, we duplicate the top element of the stack because we need the parameter and the storage in two separate elements of the stack to be able to put them together in one single string.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"image-container\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"https://hackernoon.com/photos/mQU6SDxQCbfInNVd2wDklqKZtwy1-ria73zkn\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eMichelson doesn’t have variables and is immutable by nature. New elements of the stack can be created with different methods — for example, by pushing them (with the \\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003ePUSH\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e instruction) or by duplicating them (with the \\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003eDUP\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e instruction). Remember at every step of the execution, you’re dealing with the top element of the stack. It’s the only one you can work with.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eLet’s start with the first element of the stack, and let’s get the parameter out of the pair. We use the \\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003eCAR\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e instruction, whose purpose is to break an element of type \\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003epair\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e and to return the left side of the pair (in this case, the parameter passed to the smart contract). After running \\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003eCAR\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e, we’re left with the string \\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003eworld\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e on top of the stack.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"image-container\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"https://hackernoon.com/photos/mQU6SDxQCbfInNVd2wDklqKZtwy1-tvbb3z5e\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eNow you may be wondering: How can I work with the second element of the stack if Michelson only deals with the first one? It’s very easy! Bring the second element to the top with the \\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003eSWAP\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e instruction, and keep the other one for later.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"image-container\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"https://hackernoon.com/photos/mQU6SDxQCbfInNVd2wDklqKZtwy1-zbc83zjo\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eWhen using the \\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003eSWAP\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e instruction, you tell Michelson: “I don’t need the first element for now, but I’d like to work on the second one.” Michelson will bring down the first element to the second position and the second element up to the first position.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eNow that the second pair we duplicated at the beginning is at the top, we can use a reverse \\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003eCAR\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e to get the right part of the pair with the \\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003eCDR\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e instruction.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"image-container\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"https://hackernoon.com/photos/mQU6SDxQCbfInNVd2wDklqKZtwy1-ahd53zh6\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe \\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003eCDR\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e instruction works like the \\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003eCAR\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e instruction, but you’ll keep the right side of the pair you’re manipulating (a pair always contains only two elements, so \\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003eCDR\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e and \\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003eCAR\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e are the only possible operations).

The operation takes the two strings currently at the top of the stack and returns a single string. For the operation to be successful, two conditions must be true:\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003col\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003eYou do have two elements on top of the stack (it’ll generate an error if there’s only one element left).

In this interview, we talk about the tech scene in Japan and how bitFlyer is disrupting the US market.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e1. Hi Joel, welcome to our series “Behind the Startup”. Tell us about the story behind bitFlyer and your journey into the blockchain industry?  \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThanks for having me. I appreciate it. The stereotype of startups in the US is that they are founded in garages. bitFlyer began in 2014 in a bakery in Japan. The founders, Yuzo Kano and Takafumi Komiyama, both previously worked at Goldman Sachs and saw the opportunity in Bitcoin and Blockchain early. The vision they have is to simplify the world with blockchain. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eSince then, we have entered the US and Europe and are the only exchange licensed in all three areas. We also have a separate blockchain company with a next-generation enterprise blockchain platform called “Miyabi”.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eMy background is IT and finance. I have worked in London and Tokyo in capital markets, trust banking, custody, asset management and insurance. In 2006, I started my own company using algorithms based on behavioral economics to help individuals make better-investing decisions. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIt was not as successful as bitFlyer, but it was a great experience. I became interested in Bitcoin around 2012, so I was excited to join bitFlyer to bring their technology and a Japanese level of customer service to the US.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e2. bitFlyer is the largest and the most trusted exchange in Japan. What’s the story behind bitcoin in Japan, and how is it different from others? \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eJapan has been one of the leading countries in Bitcoin for a while now. You can walk into a major electronics store and make a purchase in Bitcoin using your bitFlyer account.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe government acted early to create a national legal framework to encourage the industry and protect customers. This makes it much easier to innovate and grow the business than here in the US, where we need to work with all 50 states and the federal government to do the same things. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThere is a strong Bitcoin community that has grown through the dark days of the Mt. Gox failure to wide acceptance today. bitFlyer even runs TV commercials in Japan, which you do not see in the US.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e3. What experience and working culture does the Japanese powerhouse bitFlyer possess which it’s competitors don’t?\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIn the US, we have the expression that the customer is king. In Japan, the expression is that the customer is god. This highlights the difference in how customers are treated.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIt is this dedication to our customers, coupled with our technology and passion for the business that sets us apart. Obviously, that is a very high standard to live up to, and sometimes we do not live up to it, but it is that standard that we must pursue.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe $500 Million Coincheck hacks occurred in 2018 and that made regulators more strict about committing to the security of the exchanges to protect the interests of investors. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e4. What commitments has bitFlyer put in place for the security of funds, and do you feel that security is now among one of the unique selling points for bitFlyer to its global customer base? \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eSecurity is absolutely critical, and we spend significant resources and effort to protect our customers. We implemented multi-sig, 2FA, and store almost all customer assets in cold wallets. We have neutral 3rd parties review our systems and processes so we can continuously improve our security. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eI think it is important to note that bitFlyer does not try to take shortcuts like many of our competitors. Our 2.5 million customers trust us with their money for a reason. We protect customer money, we do not go offline when the market is volatile, and we do not abandon our customers to avoid regulation. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e5. Regulation is the way going forward for the blockchain industry. How has bitFlyer invested its time into strengthening its relationship with state and federal regulators? What are its benefits and indicators? \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003ebitFlyer was a founding member of the Japan Blockchain Association (JBA) and the Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association (JVCEA) which is the Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for crypto exchanges in Japan. In the US, we joined together with Gemini Trust to create the Virtual Commodities Association (VCA) with the goal of developing the first crypto SRO in the US. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eWe were also the first non-US company to receive the New York BitLicense (fourth overall) in 2017 and currently holds licenses to operate in 47 US states and territories. We have a very respected Chief Compliance Officer in David Zacks, who has experience on both the business side and regulatory side of the industry. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eObviously, we take regulations and protecting our customers very seriously. While regulation in the US is difficult to navigate due to the lack of clarity between states and federal authority, we think it is essential to work with regulators to have common-sense rules that allow for innovation while still protecting customers. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eWe need to work together to expand the benefits of blockchain technology beyond the core community.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e6. From a pure product perspective, what does bitFlyer US offer to retail investors that separates itself from the rest of its competitors? \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eI think the primary differentiation is that we care about our customers and doing right by them. There are competitors with fancy interfaces, offer 125X leverage and have more coins. However, those are not necessarily in the best interests of the customers. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eWe focus on a simple interface that allows customers to buy coins easily without wasting their time. We minimize leverage to protect customers from taking on too much risk. We only list coins that solve real problems. There are many things that we can do better, and we love it when our customers work with us to make bitFlyer better. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e7. What products does bitFlyer offer to its institutional clients, and what’s the value proposition for them? \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eOur founders came from Goldman Sachs so our trading exchange, called Lightning, was built for professional traders and institutional clients. We have low fees compared to other exchanges and APIs made for institutional trading. Institutional clients can use the same APIs and tap liquidity in our US, EU and Japan markets. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eWe also have account managers assigned to our institutional clients to quickly handle any issues and make sure we listen to them and continually deliver value to them. Lastly, we work with institutional clients that want to use entities in the Cayman Islands or Hong Kong to make sure their on-boarding process is smooth and meets all US KYC and regulator requirements with minimal hassle.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e8. Do you believe that quantitative easing is going to have an effect on the cryptocurrency market and its curve of adoption?\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eAn excellent question. I have always been more of a fundamental investor rather than a technical trader. I can understand the value of scarcity on the supply side, but what drives cryptocurrency on the demand side, other than psychology? \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe logic is that massive increases in money supply will devalue fiat currency relative to scarce assets like Bitcoin and increase their demand. I agree with that logic, but when? Japan has been printing money for decades and is still on the brink of deflation. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eI saw a chart the other day comparing US interest rates to the monetary base as a percentage of GDP. The time frame for interest rates rising after\\u003cbr/\\u003emassive currency printing was measured in decades.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIt is fun to speculate on the price of Bitcoin or whatever your favorite asset is, but the real question for our industry is what value are we delivering to our customers. How are we making their lives better, saving them time or money? If a crypto exchange needs a major bull run in Bitcoin to survive, then they have the wrong business model.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e9. The Coronavirus pandemic has led to a financial crisis worldwide. How is bitFlyer approaching this problem and what opportunities do you see ahead amidst this coronavirus pandemic? \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eWe moved very early to fully remote working, and it has gone well so far. Digitally native companies like bitFlyer already have significant advantages, and the decentralization mantra of the crypto world is another strength. The pandemic has highlighted those advantages even further. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eI think remote working will expand significantly, with companies that have cultures that embrace decentralization thriving and companies that don’t revert back to centralized offices. The commercial real estate industry will be hurting for years to come.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e10. What trends and challenges do you use for the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry in the year 2020 going forward? \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eJust like necessity is the mother of invention; the invention is the mother of necessity. Satoshi’s blockchain / Bitcoin invention to address the failures of the 2008 financial crisis has created new industries that did not previously exist. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eWe are still in the early days of this Cambrian explosion of innovation. I do not know how it will look in the end, but the companies that are solving real problems and are passionate about their mission should thrive, and the scams that are leeching off of that innovation should die off. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe one thing I know for sure is that this is a fun time to be in the industry, and I am going to enjoy the journey.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eThe purpose of this article is to remove informational asymmetry existing today in our digital markets by performing due diligence by asking the right questions and equipping readers with better opinions to make informed decisions.

Consumer listening apps for general podcast content\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eA lot of startup activity is happening on the consumer side of listening apps: Many startups are capitalizing on the opportunity to create a better listener experience, given that Apple Podcasts is relatively simple and bare-bones, and until recently, there has been no default listening app for Android users. Issues these apps are addressing include better discovery of podcasts through algorithms, curation, or social signals; more effective ways to search for relevant content (e.g. by automatically transcribing podcasts so as to be able to search within them); or improved social features.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eWe on the consumer team tend to believe that better podcast discovery, recommendations, and other user-facing features alone aren’t sufficient to draw a large listener base. The core of what users are interacting with on a listening app is the content itself — after all, it’s normal for listeners to start playing audio content, then to background the app or put their phones away, so the listening app becomes secondary to the content. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eAs a result, many podcasting startups have expressed interest in offering some flavor of exclusive content, as well as monetization options for creators, in order to further differentiate themselves.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eHere’s a small sample of the approaches some of these new listening apps are taking:\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cul\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003eCharging consumers directly for podcasts — these apps’ exclusive podcasts account for a relatively small share of all of the content available in these apps.

As outlined above, podcasting was historically synonymous with audio distributed via RSS — now, with the rise of exclusive, paid podcasts, \\u003ca href=\\\"https://a16z.com/2019/04/02/podcast-about-podcasting-industry-ecosystem-state-of-podcasting-2019/\\\"\\u003ethe distinction\\u003c/a\\u003e between podcasting and other audio content is becoming less meaningful.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eThe potential for network effects.\\u003c/strong\\u003e We’ve written extensively about \\u003ca href=\\\"https://a16z.com/2016/03/07/all-about-network-effects/\\\"\\u003enetwork effects\\u003c/a\\u003e and \\u003ca href=\\\"https://a16z.com/2018/12/13/16-metrics-network-effects/\\\"\\u003ehow to measure them\\u003c/a\\u003e; the consumer team loves businesses with network effects! Network effects in audio could take different forms. Like many content platforms, there’s a two-sided marketplace network effect, where more high-quality content makes the platform more valuable to consumers, and more users makes it more appealing for content producers to distribute their content there. All things being equal, most users would prefer to use the platform that has the largest, best inventory of audio content. A\\u003cbr/\\u003e social audio app could also have direct network effects, where the experience becomes better with more users/friends.While we prefer full-stack startups that own the experience end to end (positive feedback loops from listening app to content to \\u003cbr/\\u003emonetization), we wouldn’t rule out breakout apps that are strong on any one aspect.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eHigh-quality differentiated and deeper content vs. broad, free libraries of shallower content.\\u003c/strong\\u003e Since the large incumbents seek content that appeals to their large user bases, they’re less focused on seemingly niche, in-depth content. We also believe that for certain high-value content verticals, there’s potential to shift the burden of payment to businesses, schools, or other organizations — rather than on to end consumers.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eConsumption experience that enhances the experience of the audio content.\\u003c/strong\\u003e This\\u003cbr/\\u003e could be through live, social audio, or other features that increase stickiness and engagement. For instance, Headspace’s meditation streaks, animations, multi-level categorization, and session length options differentiate and enhance the experience, compared to listening to meditation audio content on general podcast listening apps.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAlternative monetization beyond solely ads\\u003c/strong\\u003e (Connie Chan \\u003ca href=\\\"https://a16z.com/2018/12/07/when-advertising-isnt-enough-multimodal-business-models-product-strategy/\\\"\\u003ehas written\\u003c/a\\u003e a lot about this). Given the dominance of existing large platforms like Google and Facebook for ad targeting, it’s becoming increasingly challenging to build a new large company based on advertising alone. We are bullish about audio companies that are aiming to monetize users directly — this could be accomplished through charging for content that has higher perceived ROI, or by introducing payments as a way to alter the content experience (e.g. social recognition after tipping in live streams). More importantly, it’s also a way to align incentives of consumers with content creators.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003eWhat could some examples of these startups look like?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e1.

Without being too prescriptive on what this looks like (we want founders to tell us!), the fact is, audio content today is still largely broadcast in nature, with a one-directional flow of information from creator to listener. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eWhile there are some conversations happening around audio content (including on Twitter, Reddit, and other forums), they happen in a fragmented, isolated way, and on platforms that aren’t designed for that purpose.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eCall-ins to radio and live talk shows are two current forms of interactive audio, with the social element fundamentally contributing to the content itself.

Also, their technology isn\\u0026#x27;t all bad. The use-cases they have of bringing smart contracts more mainstream is a plus. However, there are multiple reasons to believe that calling Ethereum decentralized sort of waters down the definition of decentralization. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eYou have a series of incidents in the past, and in my opinion technological barriers that prevent it from being a truly decentralized cryptocurrency.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eI wanted to start out with the fact that Ethereum isn\\u0026#x27;t yet built enough to handle data heavy or enterprise level applications. Many people remember when the game \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.cryptokitties.co/\\\"\\u003eCryptoKitties\\u003c/a\\u003e clogged their network. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eInfact, the CryptoKitties example actually jammed Ethereum\\u0026#x27;s network in the \\u003ca href=\\\"https://qz.com/1145833/cryptokitties-is-causing-ethereum-network-congestion/\\\"\\u003epast\\u003c/a\\u003e, and during that time period transaction processing times were dramatically slow. If a semi-popular app can do this much damage to Ethereum\\u0026#x27;s network, this makes one question its decentralization capabilities.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eAnother problem that you have is that Ethereum relies heavily on cloud usage. True this problem is still prominent even in Bitcoin, but for running Ethereum\\u0026#x27;s network the problem is much worse. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eAt \\u003ca href=\\\"https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/09/23/ethereum-nodes-cloud-services-amazon-web-services-blockchain-hosted-decentralization/\\\"\\u003eone point\\u003c/a\\u003e more than 60% of all Ethereum nodes relied on cloud services, and almost 25% was ran on AWS. This means the big corporations that people are trying to shift away from in favor of decentralization actually have a large amount of control on these forms of alternative tech. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThis is whether they know it or not. Obviously, this isn\\u0026#x27;t what many people expected when they thought of a decentralized future.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eAlso you have another problem. If you look at Ethereum Classic, ETC has a \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum-classic\\\"\\u003ehard cap/max supply\\u003c/a\\u003e on the total number of coins. Ethereum in itself however, has no max cap as of the time I am writing this. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThis means that the Ethereum development team haven\\u0026#x27;t set a max supply and it is more prune to hyperinfalation. Outside of a 51% attack, someone can try attacking Ethereum\\u0026#x27;s hashing power while new Ethereum is being circulated and recieve more uncle blocks as rewards. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThis is different than a 51% attack, because a centralized hashing attack that doesn\\u0026#x27;t necessarily need 51% hashing can still be done when new Ethereum is being circulated. Also, this gives Vitalik more control than other cryptos give to development teams that have a set max supply. The nature of no max supply is centralized in that aspect as well.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eBesides this, Ethereum moderators do seem to be engaging in forms of censorship. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"image-container\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hackernoon-app.appspot.com/o/images%2FgpabZ3ae5AMod6NEaJWlcWwdp7G2-vy331eyn.png?alt=media\\u0026amp;token=7309527a-0449-49d9-9ef1-82c03261f20a\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eOn the Ethereum subreddit, when I posted a question in regards to the Ethereum hard cap, it was immediately removed by moderators without warning.

Initiatives like these are very important, as some of the best partnerships are coming from random interactions at conferences. If we simply decide to skip one year of such meetings, we’re stopping the space from growing, something that is extremely important for technology sectors such as cryptocurrency and blockchain. Most of the technological innovations are happening in the early years.

During this conference, though, one of the most important issues of blockchain was brought up.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003eWhen will blockchain reach mass adoption?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eVinod Manoharan, CEO and Founder of \\u003ca href=\\\"http://jax.network\\\"\\u003eJax Network\\u003c/a\\u003e, participated in a discussion panel where he stated, “All we need is a scalable system which is mass adaptable so that everybody can facilitate this kind of rapid equity swaps and crowdfunding.”\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eFirst, let’s understand the blockchain scalability problem, which is known as “\\u003ca href=\\\"https://medium.com/logos-network/everything-you-know-about-the-scalability-trilemma-is-probably-wrong-bc4f4b7a7ef\\\"\\u003ethe Scalability Trilemma\\u003c/a\\u003e”. Actually, Vinod already introduced these issues during his speech: “One is the scalability problem, the second is people don\\u0026#x27;t use cryptocurrency on a large scale so there\\u0026#x27;s the mass adoption problem, and the third thing is insecurity.”\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cbr/\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIf all these three points can be achieved at the same time, blockchain will automatically reach mass adoption as more people will confidently use blockchain-powered solutions with the same efficiency as traditional ones. So the question really is:\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eHow can we improve the scalability of blockchain without reducing its security while still maintaining a decentralized network?\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cul\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003eDecentralization allows data to be distributed across multiple nodes in a network. If one node gets corrupted or forced to close down, it doesn’t affect the network in any way. That’s what makes a network censorship-resistant. Plus, the nodes are seen as equals in a democratic environment where everyone can cast an equal vote and participate in network changes. That’s why blockchain is such a powerful tool.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003eSecurity makes blockchain data trustless. Blockchain is immutable by design; this means that no data can be modified while stored in the blockchain. It also implies that no leaks or data loss can happen. And the network is resistant to hacks, such as DDoS or 51% attacks. In technology, security is a serious matter, and blockchain takes it to a level where no breaches can ever be considered.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003eScalability is the ability of the network to process thousands of transactions per second. If we ever want blockchain to be used within mainstream applications (making scalable dapps possible) it needs to be ready to process the same amount of transactions as traditional databases.\\u003cbr/\\u003e\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eAll blockchain developers are aware of the problem created here. When a blockchain system is highly decentralized, scalability becomes a challenge as the ledgers on all nodes have to be updated concurrently. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eSince \\u003ca href=\\\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-talks-scalability-ethereum-blockchain-is-almost-full\\\"\\u003eVitalik Buterin, Co-Founder of Ethereum, spoke up\\u003c/a\\u003e and challenged the smartest people to solve the Trilemma, no real solution was found. Some companies claimed to have a functional network, but upon closer inspection, they were just reducing the number of nodes. The fewer nodes you have, the more scalable the system, as it is quicker to update 10 rather than 1,000 distributed ledgers. But this means less decentralization. Back to our original problem.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eWhen Vinod brought it up during the conference mentioning that him and his team are already working on a solution for it, it made me understand that no innovation or advancement can be made in the blockchain space without overcoming the most basic issues. Once JAX Network, or any other project, will reach a functional network that has all three properties and no shortcomings, then we’ll finally see blockchain being adopted as much as the other technologies that are being used today.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eI’m grateful that even during the pandemic we are still able to see like-minded people cooperate and work together for a brighter future.

These two parameters, alongside with requested amounts (minimum and maximum) and loan term (for how long they\\u0026#x27;re borrowing money) are passed to the loan smart contract when it\\u0026#x27;s deployed and can\\u0026#x27;t be changed afterwards. There is an additional parameter though, which determines for how long the pricing phase will last.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe loan contract will run a reverse dutch auction for the length of the pricing phase, using the minimum and maximum interest rates as the starting and finishing points. This means the loan interest rate will be linearly increasing during this pricing phase and investors will commit their funds at an APR that is determined by the point in time their transactions are mined.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe catch 22 of this type of auctions is at the end of it all investors get the rate of the last one having come in. The idea behind this is it allows the market to self-regulate: investors can enter their positions at a price they feel comfortable with without suffering losses for their early commitment. Loan originators on the other hand can still control their worsts case.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eI am sure that you are aware of the security issues associated with your sector.

Our APRs ranges from 7 to 20%, which offers a significant premium over other investment instruments out there.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eI think it\\u0026#x27;s important to highlight there is no high reward / low risk investment; the primary tool for investor risk management is a differentiated portfolio. This is well understood for example amongst stock traders. I have a hunch this is maybe less so in the current DeFi space.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDo you believe that enabling an uncollateralized lending marketplace is an effective solution against flash loan attacks?\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eI think they are very different solutions, I\\u0026#x27;m not sure there is actually a link between the two. Traditional lending executes over a period of time measured in months. As such, a flash loan attack would need to cause effects that last that much - something that I find unlikely.

This way, investors will start collecting their principal and profits in instalments as opposed to at the end.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eFinally, we are right now in the process of designing an insurance fund, whose financing will initially come by contributing a fraction of our transaction fees (which are paid by borrowers).\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eThe extensive use of smart contracts to optimize the operations of financial platforms is fast becoming a technology trend.

It could have been the end of the trading and investment space, but it wasn’t.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003eWall Street Crash of 1929 – This one started in the US when a bubble was created by speculators borrowing money to buy shares. It had a global effect and it led to what is now known as the Great Depression (4 years of economic crush)\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003e1973–74 stock market crash – A miners\\u0026#x27; strike caused a sudden rise in oil prices which hit the London Stock Exchange\\u0026#x27;s FT 30 pretty hard. The market lost 73% during the 23 months. Nobody had hope anymore. Anyway, the London Stock Exchange is one of the world leaders today.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003eThe financial crisis of 2007–08 – It first started in the US where a package of securities with huge risks was exposed, then a global crisis was triggered when some of the European banks declared bankruptcy. The event had disastrous effects on the world economy. A decade later, the market is hitting world record highs.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003eEuropean sovereign debt crisis – This one happens just 10 years ago. After the activation of the EU–IMF bailout, Greece\\u0026#x27;s sovereign credit rating downgraded to such a low level that it triggered a decline of stock markets worldwide and of the Euro\\u0026#x27;s value.

The restrictions had to be imposed rapidly, and the US stock market was the first to respond with a sudden drop. Shortly after, the stock markets around the world followed and the prices fell simultaneously. The Dow fell more than 23% and experienced its worst first quarter in history this year, and this quarter has been the S\\u0026amp;P 500\\u0026#x27;s worst since 2008, dropping 20%.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"image-container\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"https://hackernoon.com/photos/rrklQPNbspZjuipgqdjB7er0G6e2-y02y2byw\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eHow far low can it go?

Do you want to be part of those ‘terrified investors’ they are going to read about in the future? 50 years ago the investors considered a major collapse when a 200 points drop was happening. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eAs Warren Buffett said: “The market started the century at 66. It ended it at 11,400. How did people lose money in such a period?” That’s exactly the perspective that you need to have as an investor. When you’ll understand that in the long-term the market always goes up dramatically, then you’ll see these crushes as opportunities, not catastrophes.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003eIt’s time to buy. Now what?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eWe already established that you don’t have to spend more time determining whether it\\u0026#x27;s time to buy or not.

I prepared for you a handpicked list of the best (in my perspective) trading apps available in the European region. Here they are:\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cul\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003ePlus500 – If you are looking for a serious broker, Plus500 is a global CFD (contract for differences) and FX (forex) broker, listed on the London Stock Exchange, and regulated by several top-tier financial authorities. If you are looking for a considerable safe place to make your first investment, this one must be for you. However, if you are looking to daytrade, be aware that Plus500 doesn’t allow the execution of more than one trade in a 2 minutes time.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003eCMC Markets – Global CFD, FX broker, listed on the London Stock Exchange, and founded way back in 1989. In all these years they accumulated a lot of trust in the space. Great for long-term investment if you are planning to invest only in CFDs and forex products as their product portfolio is limited.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003eeToro – A startup, established in 2007, regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and other entities. eToro is no listed on any exchange but this didn’t stop it to serve its clients all these years and accumulate the trust it needed. It has an attractive offer composed of commission-free stock and ETF trading for European clients, anyway, when it comes to forex the fees are getting pretty high.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003eAvaTrade – It becomes popular after becoming the official sponsor of the Manchester City football team. Anyway, the English sports team choose them for a reason: global CFD, FX broker, regulated by several financial authorities, such as the Central Bank of Ireland, AvaTrade trading tools are modern and trustworthy. But their product portfolio is rather limited and the popular pairs, like the EURUSD, come with high trading fees.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003eIG Markets – One of the top CFD brokers in the world. Regulated by top-tier authorities, such as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and listed on the London Stock Exchange. Add to that a modern set of trading tools and you know why it’s one of the top apps right now. It’s a pity that their product portfolio is limited to only CFD and options trading. Plus, the trading fees for stock CFDs are above the average.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eAll these apps are having the option of making a demo account where you can practice without investing a penny. You are placing trades using virtual (fake) money, getting familiar with the various order types available, and feel the thrill when your account is starting to generate money. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eAnyway, this money is fake as well. So, don’t stall too much playing around. When you are confident enough, make your first deposit and join the real market for possible profits – real profits!

Anybody – developers, exchanges, wallets, institutions and enterprises – that deals with more than just a couple of blockchain protocols knows how tedious it can be to keep switching contexts just to relearn a new set of commands and APIs. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThis was the challenge that drove us to build a tool for developers to maximize the efficiency of projects operating across different protocols. Our API tool, Ubiquity API, allows software projects that communicate with a number of different protocols to use less repetitive, standardized code that minimizes the need for switching logic to handle API differences.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eCreating such a tool in the rapidly evolving blockchain sector is no easy feat. The constant innovation in the sector meant that our solution had to stay in tune with cutting-edge developments in protocol and consensus mechanisms. Another significant consideration  is the fact that not all protocols are created equal. For this reason, our solution had to be flexible enough to deal with a lot of variation, and yet provide a uniform interface for users. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eEnsuring that our solution met these objectives required testing and development across a number of core areas:\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eOrchestration \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eUptime was crucial, and yet as we went through the different environments, it wasn’t something that was initially prioritized in the development phase. We started by using Docker Swarm, then quickly realized that more thought around orchestration was required. We migrated to Kubernetes to take advantage of what it has to offer. We also revisited how we managed configurations and secrets, and arrived at a solution we’re proud of – scalable, performant and secure. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eData resilience \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eWhile trialling a few different architecture options, we decided that adding a layer of abstraction above block and object storage would provide us the ability to be flexible around where we stored large amounts of data.

RabbitMQ was already part of our platform stack and we decided to expand its usage in other areas. Based on the robust Erlang language, RabbitMQ is a highly resilient, battle-tested message broker. Other contenders, such as NATS and Kafka, were also considered, yet RabbitMQ has proven to be just right for our needs.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMicroservices \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eWe carefully considered the hidden benefits of a monolith over microservices and decided on abstracting the services to consider the logical separation of code and where certain functionality made sense as a separate service in terms of scaling.

From the developer\\u0026#x27;s and player\\u0026#x27;s perspective, everything should be bigger and better than the previous title. Taste varies for different players. Some move on or some step backs. Like any gaming title, the sims 4 provide us with improved gameplay mechanics, better graphics, and tons of new features as a life simulation game. Here we\\u0026#x27;ve answered the web most searched question: Why sims 4 is better than Sims 3?\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eMoving Between Neighborhoods\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eWe\\u0026#x27;ll first start from the lot selection. While the current world is smaller as compared to the sims 3, and there\\u0026#x27;s no open-world scenario. The game provides us with an easy change neighborhood system. On the previous title, it wasn\\u0026#x27;t easy to move freely around different worlds. In the sims 4, if you want to take your sim to a picnic, you can just click on the world icon and your sim will be transferred there in no time. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eLoading Screen Time\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eOne big problem that sims 3 face was the loading screen time. Despite providing us with a lot of patch update and using different mods, the time was fairly long as compared to the sims 4. It is because the core language of the game engine was built around these settings. There was no other option than to patiently wait for the full game to load. The sims 4 bring a lot faster loading screen thanks to the newly using game engine and hardware support. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCreate a Sim Panel\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe next major update the franchise has received is the Create a Sim Panel. There\\u0026#x27;s no race or competition in this genre because the sims 4 CAS completely dominate the predecessor. There are a lot of customization options that you can use to make the sims of your life. There are different headers, grab and pull system, curves, sliders, and recommendation to make your sim stand out among all the NPCs.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003ePersonalities and Emotions\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe Sims 4 offers a new personality and emotional state in the game. The game has strived to make sure that your little digital avatar gets the best response of a scenario. There was a lot of controversy for this system during the launch of the game.

The sims 4 however has a huge advantage of current technology and developer\\u0026#x27;s content.

We should remember that fully \\u003ca href=\\\"https://bit.ly/Most-Cryptos-Fail\\\"\\u003e92%\\u003c/a\\u003e of all crypto projects launched will fail within the five year mark, most actually within the first 18 months.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eProjects that survive past the five year culling period, are likely, on average, to have been continually developed and added users over this time span, otherwise they would not have made it. This would suggest \\u003cem\\u003eat least\\u003c/em\\u003e a marginal increase in the price of a candidate token over this period.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThus we should approach crypto investing not as the search for a token with the best gimmick, but rather one that is strengthened from the passage of time. The Lindy Effect basically suggests that the longer a technology has been viable, the longer it is likely to stay viable. Under the Lindy effect, each day that passes strengthens our choice of asset and makes it more likely to endure for another day; making the likelihood of long term price appreciation under our model greater, and our risk (likelihood of token failure) is smaller.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eFinding instances of Lindy potential in recently launched tokens requires rewiring our brains not to look for profit, but for long lastingness. One of the key features that suggest the long lastingness of a token to an early stage investor is funding.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eAntifragility may be presumed in a token that can pay for itself. It does not require predictive ability to realize that if developers and promoters can be paid, at least for the foreseeable future, our token will only strengthen from the passage of time. The longer our token survives, the stronger the Lindy Effect will become. Survivability breeds survivability and survivability breeds profit.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eWe could much more easily dedicate ourselves to investing in established tokens, such as Bitcoin, and be done with it; the proof is in the pudding. But we believe the potential, order of magnitude returns from investing in early stage assets outweigh the risks, even taking into account the security we may gain from investing in an established token.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003ePredictive thinking is not required when choosing crypto assets. We must instead look for projects that are clearly able to finance themselves over the long term. Treasury models, such as that pioneered by Dash and adopted by other crypto assets come to mind. We wish to stay as far away from “prediction” (which is inherently fragile) as possible, and focus instead on searching for strong foundations in candidate crypto assets.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eTo be clear, we are not at all concerned with \\u003cem\\u003ewhat \\u003c/em\\u003ewill happen in the future to affect our token, we are rather concerned that the future does indeed happen; and this becomes more certain with each passing day. An informed crypto investor is thus unconcerned by market movements or crisis within his investment horizon. We are not afraid of uncertainty and volatility as long as our token continues to function.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eWe do not require complete information or a clear view of the future to execute investments, we do not wish to time or predict anything.

It’s important to build quickly, prove your value proposition and make sure you are building something people want. This causes many founders to get stuck in an “I need my team now” panic.

There are many other keyword tools available as well, and we can take advantage of a few of them to collect as much information as possible. By looking at the trends over a period of time, we can determine whether this is a seasonal product and when is a good time to sell it.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"image-container\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"https://hackernoon.com/photos/7OIDjxImu4VzpVq8BA6R6EKtpbe2-vmmf3wdh\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe keyword “shaver” has a relatively smooth curve that doesn’t seem to be influenced by seasons.

After collecting the number of reviews of each item, we can see the top 4 brands all surpassed 20,000 reviews. And the number of reviews for each brand averages around 3,000. From there, we can conclude that there is a huge demand for shavers. However, it would be not wise to compete directly with the top players as they possess a bigger part of the market pie.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003eScrape Customer Ratings\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eSo we just took a look at the number of reviews, now we can dig into the ratings. The product ratings tell us in a straightforward way how consumers are perceiving these brands and the products.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIf a single brand has tons of reviews with an extremely high average rating, it means that it is a monopoly brand. Obviously, everybody loves it and thinks this is an awesome choice. On the contrary, if the ratings of all products in a market are very low, it means that all the brands share unavoidable defects in common. What I just described are two extreme situations, and it would be unwise to enter either market.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eNow let’s go back to our case and compare the average product ratings of all brands. From left to right, the average ratings go down and the brands with the most reviews concentrate in the middle. As shown in the chart below, the shavers with the most reviews are rated between 4.0–4.4, which indicates that there is no single brand monopolizing the market and this is not a bad battlefield to compete in.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"image-container\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"https://hackernoon.com/photos/7OIDjxImu4VzpVq8BA6R6EKtpbe2-bwof3ws2\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003eAmazon Reviews as part of Product Research\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eBesides scraping the number of reviews, we can also pull the review text off Amazon directly.

As shavers are small and light-weighted (less than 1 pound on average), they have low shipping charges and take up less space. This kind of product tends to generate more profits and is easier to manage. But when picking products, avoid the ones with fragile inner parts, like glass or delicate electronics. It is better to choose something sturdy, durable and easy to hold.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003eWrapping Up\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe tips above guide us in choosing which product to sell on Amazon.

The basis of that system was a “commitment by participating countries to fix the prices of their domestic currencies in terms of a specified amount of gold. (\\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/GoldStandard.html\\\"\\u003eSource\\u003c/a\\u003e)” Such currencies, in fact, could be freely exchanged for gold at the established rates. In other words, they were backed by gold. The period between 1980 and 1914 was known as the classical gold standard. By that time, most countries had adopted a gold standard.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe gold standard, however, broke during the First World War, as some countries opted for inflationary monetary policies and stopped backing their currencies with gold (\\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/GoldStandard.html\\\"\\u003eSource\\u003c/a\\u003e). Afterward, between 1925 and 1931, a new gold standard (with certain adjustments) would be implemented. However, in 1931 Britain would abandon it in response to massive gold outflows (\\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/GoldStandard.html\\\"\\u003eSource\\u003c/a\\u003e).\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eSome years later, from 1946, most countries would begin operating under the Bretton Woods system. This system, which was a further modification of the gold standard, consisted in a multilateral monetary system in which the value of the dollar was fixed to a certain amount of gold, and the value of other currencies was fixed to the dollar (\\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Money-Destruction-Dollar-Threatens-Economy/dp/0071823700\\\"\\u003eMoney, Steve Forbes\\u003c/a\\u003e). “Persistent U.S. balance-of-payments deficits steadily reduced U.S. gold reserves, however, reducing confidence in the ability of the United States to redeem its currency in gold. (\\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/GoldStandard.html\\\"\\u003eSource\\u003c/a\\u003e)” Thus, in 1971 President Nixon announced that the U.S. would no longer redeem its currency for gold, marking the end of the gold standard era (\\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/GoldStandard.html\\\"\\u003eSource\\u003c/a\\u003e).\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eSince then, the monetary system that has prevailed is the one we currently know, in which currencies are not backed by anything and in which the exchange rate between different currencies fluctuates on a daily basis.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eWith the previous reflexion, I want to highlight three points:\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003col\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003eThat money is a human invention and as such, can be improved upon.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003eThat throughout history monetary systems have tended to be unstable and can change quickly.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003eThat the current monetary system is relatively new.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003c/ol\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThese three points, in turn, allowed me to consider the possibility of new monetary systems; of new forms of money.

Its counter-intuitive nature and its implications for what we believe in can be far reaching.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eTo illustrate the idea of the relativity of value, let me begin with the story of the lobster.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIt turns out that, to my amusement, even though the lobster is considered one of the most exquisite and exclusive dishes in the world, it wasn’t always the case. In fact, less than a century ago the lobster was considered the “cockroach of the ocean” and was food for the poor, servants, and prisoners (yes, it was served in prisons). As \\u003ca href=\\\"https://psmag.com/economics/how-lobster-got-fancy-59440\\\"\\u003eDaniel Luzer\\u003c/a\\u003e puts it:\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIf today’s lobster wears a top hat and an opera cape, 80 years ago he was wearing overalls and picking up your garbage. Lobster is a self-made creature, and quite the social climber.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eHow did this happen? How did the cockroach of the ocean become the main character in the world’s most exclusive banquets?\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIn one way, it’s a story about supply and demand. “Lobsters were so abundant in the early days — residents in the Massachusetts Bay Colony found they washed up on the beach in two-foot-high piles — that people thought of them as trash food. (\\u003ca href=\\\"https://psmag.com/economics/how-lobster-got-fancy-59440\\\"\\u003eSource\\u003c/a\\u003e)” This was probably amplified by the fact that the lobster was an unknown (odd-looking) animal at the time. In this sense, the prevailing conditions created a cycle in which low demand for lobsters guaranteed their abundance and, in turn, their abundance made them look like trash, promoting the low demand.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIt’s worth highlighting, however, that it wasn’t a matter of taste; it was a matter of perception. The fact that the lobster was perceived as trash made it trash in the eyes of the residents of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. And, in turn, it was its abundance (and what it meant: that nobody wanted it) that made it look like trash.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eAn experiment done at the time corroborates this. When railways started to proliferate across the United States, certain railroad managers decided to take advantage of the fact that their passengers didn’t know what lobster was, to offer it as an exotic dish within their trains (\\u003ca href=\\\"https://psmag.com/economics/how-lobster-got-fancy-59440\\\"\\u003eSource\\u003c/a\\u003e). The result: passengers loved it. Since then, its consumption began to get popular across the U.S. Even though it wasn’t immediately considered high cuisine, by the 1850s it was already being served in some restaurants across the country.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThis amazing experiment shows the importance of perception when valuing the lobster. While those who knew of its abundance considered it trash, those that didn’t know anything about it were intrigued by its taste.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIts elite status, however, would take some time to develop. It wouldn’t be until after World War Two that the lobster would begin to be considered an exclusive dish, as it became popular among movie stars and millionaires.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThis peculiar story takes Daniel Luzer to conclude the following:\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cblockquote\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIf the peer behavior around the product changes, so too does our appreciation of it. Lobster might seem to taste better to us because it’s so expensive.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/blockquote\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eI completely agree with him. If you don’t believe so, imagine the following: instead of being scarce, we live in a world in which diamonds are as abundant as sand; you can find them everywhere. Do you think their price would be the same? Do you think women would still dream about them in that scenario? Probably not. The fact that makes diamonds so crave-worthy is the fact that they’re expensive; the fact that they’re scarce.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003eThe relativity of the value of money\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIn the same way, as value is relative in relation to what we eat, it’s also relative in relation to money.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eEven though we don’t necessarily perceive it, the value of money changes constantly through time. It’s because of this that prices of goods and services tend to increase year after year. In the background, what’s really happening is that the money we’re using is losing value through time. In other words, what changes year after year isn’t the goods and services we consume, but the money we use to buy them, which tends to be worth less each year.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThis phenomenon is known as inflation and, at risk of over-simplifying a complex topic, happens because of the tendency of there being more and more money chasing a limited amount of goods and services within the economy.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe next image, which shows the value of the dollar throughout the years, illustrates this phenomenon in a clear way.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"image-container\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"https://devcdn.hackernoon.com/photos/6gIrvIcQwUepoybsXCq5ZrclLxq2-myhm30tx\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.danheld.com/\\\"\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eSource\\u003c/em\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003e\\u003c/em\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eAs can be observed, the dollar has lost more than 90% of its value since 1910.

Even though it doesn’t cover the whole period, the following graph helps visualize this phenomenon since the 1980s.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"image-container\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"https://devcdn.hackernoon.com/photos/6gIrvIcQwUepoybsXCq5ZrclLxq2-bs13s30cf\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eM2 is a measure of the quantity of dollars in the economy.\\u003c/em\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIt’s worth noting that the dollar has been the strongest currency during that period.

In other words, there’s no international standard to measure the value of money across the globe (or at least not an independent one, like the metric system). Today, for instance, if you want to know how much is a Colombian peso worth in Turkish liras, you first have to convert the peso into dollars (which is a country’s currency), and then, the dollars into liras. You may say the dollar is the international standard of measure. However, the difference with respect to the metric system is that the dollar is a country’s currency. It’s not independent.

While he never said those exact words, Hal Finney was implicitly among the loudest voices chanting Bitcoin’s no-discounting mantra as one of the most important people in the history of Bitcoin.

They do not prefer waiting for your support team to reply to their emails or calling the customer care center. The main reason they cannot resolve an issue on their own is because of the lack of or too little information available online.  \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eAs per a survey reported on \\u003ca href=\\\"https://hbr.org/2017/01/kick-ass-customer-service\\\"\\u003eHarvard Business Review\\u003c/a\\u003e, 81% of customers prefer finding the answer to their matters themselves before reaching out to a support agent.

Investing in AI will also help marketers personalize advertisements like never before, as these clever machines can determine consumer preferences far easier than a human can, before matching advertisements to those preferences to maximize the effect of the marketing effort.

Whenever a user or the system activities interaction, a trigger occurs. It encourages users to take action. There are two types of triggers - manual triggers and system triggers.\\r\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\r\\u003cstrong\\u003eUser-initiated trigger:\\u003c/strong\\u003e These triggers happen when a user interacts with a product intentionally. This could be a toggle switch that can turn a component on and off. Even a push of a button or a clap or hand wave comes under the category of manual triggers.\\r\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\r\\u003cstrong\\u003eSystem-initiated triggers:\\u003c/strong\\u003e These type of triggers require a prerequisite event for activation. They occur automatically when a situation occurs. For instance, getting a notification on the phone when the installation of an app is complete is a system trigger. Another example of a system trigger is when a user starts a trigger by typing a wrong password. The wrong credentials prompt the user to enter the correct password.\\r\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eRules\\r\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\rRules determine what happens to a microinteraction post activation. They determine how microinteractions acknowledge triggers. Designers have to ensure that these rules are easy-to-use and fulfil the requirements of the customers, with the least number of errors. \\r\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\rAn excellent example of this is when users try to send email through Gmail without filling the “To” box. If anyone does so, Gmail prompts the user with an error dialogue- “Please specify at least one recipient.“ Users can fill the email addresses of their recipients to send the email.\\r\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eFeedback\\r\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe feedback event lets the users know that their action has been acknowledged. To verify microinteractions, feedback notifies users visually, audibly or by the sense of touch. A sound, vibration or animation in a smartphone can let users understand feedback. For example, when you use a fitness tracker app for walking, as soon as you reach your walking goal, your phone vibrates.\\r\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\rAnother simple illustration of feedback is the validation method used in filling forms. While using forms, inline validation is helpful for users in understanding if something is wrong. If a user enters characters in a field that asks for age, a red cross mark will appear specifying the suitable format of characters for the field. Similarly, green checkmarks indicate the fields that users have filled correctly.\\r\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\rLoops and Modes\\r\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eBoth loops and modes represent the critical meta-rules of microinteractions. Loops define the period of micro-interactions and determine if they need repetitions or new requirements. One of the popular examples of loops is the way Google Photos makes a collection of photos as “memories from the previous year every month. Though this is done repetitively, it is not necessary to repeat each microinteraction.\\r\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\rSuch user experiences adapt over time based on the behaviour of users. It also results in a better UX every time users interact with a product. With every loop of “memories”, users enjoy revisiting a collection of old pictures.\\r\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\rModes are used to modify the way certain functionalities work. For instance, if you wish to put your phone on “Flight mode” or “DND mode”, it sets the phone to the respective modes. Another example is a circumstance when a user types an incorrect password more than three times. The account goes to a “blocked” mode for a certain period.\\r\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eGetting into action: Some real-world examples\\r\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eMicrointeractions are a game-changer when it comes to communicating effectively with the user. In UX/UI, designers usually try to use unique ways to achieve this goal. Enhancing the user experience is necessary to keep your users content with an application. Here are a few real-world examples of microinteractions used in apps.\\r\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\rSwipe\\r\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe swipe feature is more interactive than tapping. It is a common feature used to switch between tabs/windows. It allows users to navigate through an application effortlessly. One of the most popular apps for dating is Tinder. Swiping is an integral part of the UX. It is a microinteraction that serves the purpose of answering a yes or no to a question. Users can swipe right if they like or swipe left if they don\\u0026#x27;t like their possible match.\\r\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\rPull to refresh\\r\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eMost of the browser applications don’t have a refresh button now. Users just have to press and hold to pull the screen and that is enough to reload a page. Designers can experiment with adding some attractive animations to keep the users engaged while the page is still loading. \\r\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\rFor instance, the \\u003ca href=\\\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.application.zomato\\u0026amp;hl=en_US\\\"\\u003eZomato app\\u003c/a\\u003e uses a unique technique to keep the users glued to the app. The app shows quirky facts about food from the world and lets users get lost in it for some time. Meanwhile, the page gets loaded and they forgot how much time the page needed to load. \\r\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\rReacting to social media posts\\r\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe recent \\u0026quot;care\\u0026quot; reaction emoji added by Facebook for reacting to social media posts is one great example of how designers should empathise with users. Whether it is just the \\u0026quot;like\\u0026quot; button or the \\u0026quot;Haha\\u0026quot; button, such subtle microinteractions have become a common UX design pattern now. Many apps and websites use this micro-interaction to understand their users and make them feel connected with the application. \\r\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eThings to keep in mind\\r\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"image-container\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"https://hackernoon.com/photos/QMKq2q2ygzOjZMCJoxY8OW6U4bA3-5823w3w\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e                                        Image source: Google\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cul\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\rSimplicity is the key to create a good user experience.\\u003c/strong\\u003e Never over-design.

Take education or even ecommerce. We did expect, in early 2020, that one day our kids or their kids would all be learning online, or that we would be increasingly buying much of our groceries online. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eBut if asked to predict when, we would likely have said a few years to a decade out. And yet, here we are, a few months on, our kids all on Microsoft Teams or Zoom, and us using Milkbasket or Amazon or Instacart to get our groceries.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eCOVID accelerated digital adoption significantly, and advanced the future considerably; hence the metaphor of COVID as time machine. And in catalysing digital adoption, it actually led to a new type of product where the physical aspects of the product are being decoupled or unbundled from the core service. In education for instance, it unbundled or decoupled daycare or social aspects from the actual learning component. In retail, it unbundled the transaction from the experience.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eAs we decouple and unbundle more and more physical offerings, such as movie watching or dining, we are casting away all of the social aspects associated with it and thereby moving from communal to \\u003ca href=\\\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/open-patent/singular-social-and-streamed-welcome-to-a-post-covid-world/\\\"\\u003esingular consumption\\u003c/a\\u003e. And that brings us to this question? How many of these physical business models or offerings — be it schools or movie theatres — see themselves as offering socialisation in addition to its core functional offering? \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eDo schools see themselves as disguised daycare, or a space for kids to develop friendships as much as a space for learning math? Do movie halls or theatres see themselves as a space for friends or lovers to spend time together while communally sharing an artistic experience?\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eI am not so sure.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003eDisguised social\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eA friend of mine runs a weekly cooking class for kids in the Bay Area. Unfortunately with COVID and the social distancing norms in place, she had to drop it. While she could theoretically do an online class, the challenge with cooking classes for kids is that you need supervision and that means that an online class now needs the parent to actually commit her attention to the class and supervise her kid. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eWhereas if it was a physical class, the parent could drop the kid and hit a cafe or a bookstore for some me time. For the parent it was a double whammy — not only was it more screen time for the kid (which was exactly what the parent was looking to avoid, but it also meant that an hour or more from her schedule had to be committed. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eNot to forget other related inconveniences such as organising the ingredients, which were earlier done by my friend.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eOn the other hand, my Crossfit coach was able to move about half or so of his class online. They meet on Zoom and work out (I couldn’t stand another zoom hour and skipped). In his case, his customers were willing to overcome the ‘weak’ socialisation component of the online workout, because they still were able to get the calendaring element i.e. a schedule that they felt pressured to join. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eOne reason why Crossfit or a group exercise class like Soulcycle works over the traditional solo gym visit is because of the pressure of the group. This is also the reason why most of the yoga / dance instructors have been able to move a reasonable number of their clients online. There isn’t any special equipment required and the group classes meant that there is sufficient pressure to join.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIt is useful to look at these two instances and see how different elements were bundled with the core functional offering — learning or fitness. In case of the cooking class, daycare / social was bundled, while in the latter case we saw calendaring bundled with fitness. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe bundling or the nature of the bundle isn’t a conscious choice. It emerges from the physical (distribution) format of the offering. Still it isn’t apparent to many providers of physical offerings that there are elements of daycare, social or calendaring / commitment integrated with the core offering.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eAn example of a brand that recognised this was Ikea. In many of their larger stores they have a section called Smaland where kids are left alone to play in a cordoned play area, under minimal but sufficiently effective supervision. Occasionally parents \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/11/garden/11ikea.html\\\"\\u003egame it\\u003c/a\\u003e to get free daycare. I have struggled to find other similar examples. Yes, there are play areas — most commonly in malls, but they are really spaces where the parent has to accompany the kid. At least this is what I have noticed thus far in India.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIn marketing literature, we would call of these individual components as serving different types of jobs-to-be-done. We hire a pricey restaurant on an anniversary, not so much for the food alone, but for the ambience, and to signal to each other that it is a special occasion. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eSo if due to COVID you are in lockdown and cant leave the house, then you can’t just replace the going out with a dining in; you need to add back consciously the missing elements that serve the core job to be done, which in this case is signalling the specialness of the occasion. So you may be better off hiring an online musical performance, or even cooking a special meal together. The replacement product looks nothing like what the original was.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003eAdding back social / rebundling\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eBundling, unbundling and rebundling is a common theme in tech. We started with the CD, and then unbundled it into the song (mp3), and \\u003ca href=\\\"https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling\\\"\\u003erebundled it into the stream (itunes, spotify etc.)\\u003c/a\\u003e. Then there is the rebundle I heard of in Argentina, and this has nothing to do with tech, where they unbundled the (fun) wedding from the (boring) marriage, and added theatrics and drama, to create a new kind of faux wedding that is called \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/world/americas/argentina-fake-wedding-falsa-boda.html\\\"\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003efalsa boda\\u003c/em\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eRebundling of social is a theme that I see emerging as digital becomes the default; as more and more physical (and bundled) experiences or offerings go digital, we will start seeing socialization or daycare elements being added back consciously to the digital element as a discrete and separately configurable component. We watched movies w friends in cinemas. Now we watch Netflix alone so now we want Netflix party.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eAlternately we may also see social or communality as a service by itself.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eImagine PVR or INOX or other movie chains offering a daycare show a la Ikea. Say, old cartoons playing on loop in a well-lit theatre where kids can play with social distancing measures enforced via the presence of staff at hand, while parents are free to drop off their kids and go shopping.

When I am inclined to do some research, I stumbled upon an old Techcrunch article entitled, \\u003ca href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2006/07/15/is-twttr-interesting/\\\"\\u003eOdeo Releases Twttr\\u003c/a\\u003e. I also found an interesting \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8N0xN0ihMA\\\"\\u003evideo\\u003c/a\\u003e online by a popular independent film maker. It is entitled, \\u0026quot;Scandal and Betrayal: The Story of How Twitter Started\\u0026quot;, and can be seen \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8N0xN0ihMA\\\"\\u003ehere\\u003c/a\\u003e. The video in question raises concerns about the less commonly known Twitter co-founder Noah Glass. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eNoah Glass seemed to push the idea of Jack Dorsey pursuing Twitter. He came up with the name \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-twitter-was-founded-2011-4\\\"\\u003eTwttr\\u003c/a\\u003e. Even Evan Williams seemed not to be so into the concept of Twitter. Something very suspicious isn\\u0026#x27;t only that Noah Glass seemed to be forced out of the company, but that Evan Williams \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/christianwolan/2011/04/14/the-real-story-of-twitter/#bcd814366af8\\\"\\u003ebought back early Twitter related shares\\u003c/a\\u003e from investors, making it look like he is saving them from grief. Twitter shortly surged in value afterwords. Years later an unrelated investor lawsuit against Twitter claimed that Twitter execs \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.scribd.com/document/328970586/Twitter-Shareholder-Suit\\\"\\u003einflated share price\\u003c/a\\u003e in a different incident. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eI believe the case was \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.law.com/delawarelawweekly/2020/06/15/investors-case-against-twitter-reopened-in-del-as-calif-suit-takes-23-months-to-resolve/?slreturn=20200515222503\\\"\\u003ereopened\\u003c/a\\u003e, and that a \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191104005935/en/Shareholder-Alert-Robbins-LLP-Announces-Twitter-TWTR\\\"\\u003eseparate complaint\\u003c/a\\u003e with similar allegations is also going on.

It used to be thought off as a platform promoting intellectual diversity. However, growing concerns of censorship has been going on. This isn\\u0026#x27;t even with Twitter, but with social media giants in general. I personally had to \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1092977087736492032\\\"\\u003edelete my Facebook profile\\u003c/a\\u003e over censorship concerns I believe may have been preventing my brand growth. I also had to recently privatize my personal Twitter account because of censorship concerns and a dropped following in a certain political niche. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eNow, in my opinion I am being censored. Although, I am not trying to directly say it or that I\\u0026#x27;m certain of the censorship, things are looking suspicious.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eBoth \\u003ca href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Facebook\\\"\\u003eFacebook\\u003c/a\\u003e and \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/28/new_twitter_censorship_rules_raise_transparency_questions_143049.html\\\"\\u003eTwitter\\u003c/a\\u003e has censorship concerns. They also have privacy concerns. An example is that early on in the founding of Facebook, Zuckerberg at the time still called his early users \\u0026quot;\\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.esquire.com/uk/latest-news/a19490586/mark-zuckerberg-called-people-who-handed-over-their-data-dumb-f/\\\"\\u003edumb f*cks\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u0026quot;, which have been \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.businessinsider.com/embarrassing-and-damaging-zuckerberg-ims-confirmed-by-zuckerberg-the-new-yorker-2010-9\\\"\\u003econfirmed\\u003c/a\\u003e. That being said, some people are still trying to defend social media moguls. \\u003ca href=\\\"https://slate.com/technology/2020/06/twitter-fact-checking-trump-misinformation-censorship.html\\\"\\u003eSlate\\u003c/a\\u003e for example, said that social media fact checking isn\\u0026#x27;t censorship. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eHowever, Twitter isn\\u0026#x27;t a moderation platform. Removing misinfo, hate speech, etc. isn\\u0026#x27;t part of Twitter\\u0026#x27;s job. I say allow the dumb statements to be there in order for them to be ridiculed and point out why they are dumb. If you allow someone to censor something because it is incorrect, you are slowly giving them the authoritarian power to state what they believe is incorrect. Eventually you are seeing stuff \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-has-gone-from-bastion-of-free-speech-to-global-censor-2017-6\\\"\\u003ebeing scrubbed\\u003c/a\\u003e that may not even be factually incorrect, but on the side of a controversial \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-has-gone-from-bastion-of-free-speech-to-global-censor-2017-6\\\"\\u003eopinion\\u003c/a\\u003e. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eOutside of social media, you even have actual moderation platforms also being criticized of bias.

It was first launched in China as Douyin in late 2016. In the year 2017, ByteDance launched the app for markets outside China. Douyin and TikTok use the same software but maintain separate network databases because of censorship restrictions in China. Now, TikTok is available all across the globe in Google play store and App store.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eMany of them are wondering why TikTok appears oddly when it is similar to musical.ly. And there is a great reason why. In late 2017, Musical.ly was purchased by TikTok\\u0026#x27;s parent company. As a result of uniting, TikTok targeted the US\\u0026#x27;s teenage market, which previously belonged to musical.ly. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eTikTok\\u0026#x27;s primary mission is \\u0026quot;to capture the talents and skills of the people worldwide, gain knowledge and precious moments directly from the mobile phone. TikTok makes everyone as a creator to share their skilled factors and expressions through their short term videos.\\u0026quot; So, TikTok fights with Google, Facebook, and Instagram, which has the backup of Google and Facebook.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eTikTok is an entertaining platform more than a lifestyle platform that makes them stand out among the heavy competition. And also, the next factor is that anyone can become a content creator because of the app\\u0026#x27;s simplicity to use. It\\u0026#x27;s the top reason to reach out to the world.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eNow, you understand what TikTok is, let\\u0026#x27;s dive into the easy statistics of TikTok at current and why it is useful for marketers. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003eHow many users does TikTok have?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eTikTok launched in late 2016, and it has spread widely in the two years since its launch. It has 850 million active users till now and stands in 9th position in social media networks. TikTok stands ahead of LinkedIn, Snapchat, etc.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIt\\u0026#x27;s a fact that 155 million active users every day are from China. They mostly use the network Douyin which is the Chinese version app. Many Asian countries mostly welcome TikTok. Did you know this fact? It takes six years for Instagram to achieve the same amount of followers that TikTok gained in just three years. And for Facebook, it took nearly four years to hit the active users.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003eHow many downloads does TikTok have?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eTikTok has crowned the most downloaded app in recent years; it has one billion downloads in the App store and 1.5 billion downloads in Google Play store in the single year 2019. TikTok reached their one billion followers in Feb2019, and within eight months, it gained half-billion more followers quickly. The latest statistics of TikTok have delivered the fact that the app was downloaded 615 million times from Jan to Nov 2019. It makes a six percent increase than the previous year and clearly shows it crossed the acquired followers in 2018.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIf growth strategies hold standard, then the app will likely be the best non-gaming app of 2019, behind WhatsApp with 707.4 million and Facebook messenger with 636.2 million installs, respectively. Also, it will rank ahead of Facebook and Instagram easily in terms of social media giants.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eAn interesting fact is that TikTok is the only app not owned by Facebook. Another effect of TikTok to grow its popularity is that since it launched in late 2016, TikTok has been ranked in 7th position of the top ten most downloaded apps ahead of Twitter and YouTube.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003eIt conquers teens of the world:\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eTikTok has hit the best when it comes to youngsters in the world. Forty-five percent of TikTok active users aged between 16 and 24. TikTok becomes the top reach among teenagers, but some adults never heard the news about it, and it\\u0026#x27;s mainly because of design. TikTok has designed the app for the under 18 aged audience, and their main target was the teenagers. So, we can say that TikTok understands the youngsters better than the other social media networks. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThough they selected under 18 as their audience, they quickly knew the habits and preferences for what they expected. It allows all the followers as creators as they can do videos on dancing, singing, lip-syncing, etc. It helps teenagers to bring out their creativity through TikTok. In the high competition of teenagers to qualify them out on TikTok, they tend to \\u003ca href=\\\"https://bouxtie.com/\\\"\\u003ebuy real TikTok likes\\u003c/a\\u003e which helps to overtake competitor’s videos on TikTok network.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003eTikTok usages by Country:\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe download boost came from Asia more for TikTok, especially in India. In the year 2019 alone, India brings out 277 million downloads, which acquires nearly half of the total downloads in that entire year. And also, it is 60% downloads from India overall. That is, six out of every ten downloads of TikTok are from India. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eIndia was followed by China with 46 million downloads and the United States with 38 million downloads, respectively, in 2019.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eFrom the total downloads of the TikTok app, 467 million downloads came from India, which is 31 percent, and 174 million downloads are from China. Both the countries made the TikTok app to reach nearly 40 percent of the total downloads. Following this, the United States gave their 8.3 percent full downloads, which are 124 million downloads to the TikTok app. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eTikTok app usage is widespread in south Asia, and this platform is very adaptive.

New technologies that personalize and improve the possibilities for human connections across contexts will be the new killer apps.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eCertain apps lend themselves to great interactions. Video chat has nearly all the personal touches of an in-person conversation. You can pick up subtle cues from body language and even the smallest facial expressions.

Let us get started \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003ch2\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eWhat is the memento design pattern?\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe memento design pattern’s intent is to externalize an object’s internal state so that the object can be restored to that state later without violating the encapsulation principle. Game applications need to maintain snapshots of the levels the player has played. As the user progresses to different levels in a game, chances of encountering a game-ending situation increases. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eMost games allow users to restart the game from the previous level. The ideas of memento design pattern are being used in most of the circumstances when it comes to storing and restoring state in games.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eAnother example can be drawn from a drawing application like paint in Microsoft’s Windows operating system or any other graphical editor that supports connecting objects. We can create two circles and join them using a line. Now, if we move the system of rectangles by either selecting the whole figure or by any other means, the rectangles should stay connected. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe graphic editor makes sure that the line stretches appropriately to maintain the connection between the rectangles. If we are trying to create a graphic editor of our own, we can use the memento design pattern to ensure that the desired effect is achieved. Such applications make use of an object that calculates the length, position, and angle using mathematical equations. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThat object takes the help of the memento design pattern’s toolbox objects to store the previous constraints (length, position, angle). So that, if the user moves the rectangular system next time the previous state can be used to determine the next position. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe memento design pattern consists of an object that stores a snapshot of the internal state of another object, which is the memento’s originator. The mechanism for undo requests a memento from the originator when it needs the list of checkpoints from the originator’s state. The originator is the one that initializes the memento with information that characterizes its current state. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThe restriction is that the originator is the only one that stores and retrieves the information from the memento.

As the allocated memory fills up, it will choose to evict the least recently accessed data. Both of these operations are asynchronous and can cause a noticeable overhead in data access speeds, especially as the amount of data cached on a node nears saturation.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eSolution:\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\u003cul\\u003e\\u003cli\\u003eWe configured Alluxio to avoid evicting data and disabled features that would cache duplicate copies of the same data. By default, Alluxio caches data read from the underlying storage system, which is beneficial for access patterns where the same data is requested repeatedly. However, DL training typically reads the entire dataset, which can easily exceed Alluxio’s cache capacity as datasets are generally on the order of terabytes. We can tune how Alluxio caches data by setting \\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003ealluxio.user.ufs.block.read.location.policy\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e to \\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003ealluxio.client.block.policy.LocalFirstAvoidEvictionPolicy\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e, which will avoid evicting data to reduce the load on each individual worker, and setting \\u003cpre\\u003e\\u003ccode\\u003ealluxio.user.file.passive.cache.enabled\\u003c/code\\u003e\\u003c/pre\\u003e to false to avoid caching additional copies.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e3.

Various optimizations were made to improve the experience of AlluxioFUSE performance in high concurrency reading workload. These improvements enabled us to achieve a near-optimal performance when executing a distributed model training scheme in a four-machine eight-card scenario with ResNet50.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eFor future work, Alluxio is working on enabling page cache support and FUSE layer stability. Alibaba Cloud Container Service team is collaborating with both the Alluxio Open Source Community and Nanjing University through Dr. Haipeng Dai and Dr. Rong Gu.

The player\\u0026#x27;s emotional investment comes literally from its \\u0026quot;homework\\u0026quot; like Sisyphus with its big rock. \\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eSometimes, re-balancing the features of the game can be necessary when a main winning strategy is emerging: the so-called meta (most efficient tactic available). That\\u0026#x27;s why collecting data about each game played is so essential today.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cbr/\\u003eOne other way to think about optimization needs a little introspection: what is the unspeakable secret motivation of every player (except fun)? Be smarter than others. It means calculate faster and anticipate each opponent\\u0026#x27;s move. When the calculation becomes impossible, due to lack of time or too much information, the player has a natural tendency to return to a more basic strategic line. Then the game tests its ability to give up a pre-established strategy.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cbr/\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eGame theory \\u003c/strong\\u003eis not only a beautiful addition of words, it\\u0026#x27;s a well-known branch of applied mathematics and also an important field of economic studies. In short, game theory studies strategic situations where an individual or a group of people choose different actions in order to maximize their outcomes. In some way, game theory is very close to decision making under uncertainty and can be split a minima in two categories : non cooperative or cooperative games. Game theory is a very practical way to explain how cooperative interactions or behaviors lead to a better outcome for all the participants, despite a high level of competition between them. Life is all about polar opposites and moving equilibrium.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cbr/\\u003eIn my opinion, the best games seek to blend cooperation and competition to generate positive tension. As the players are facing simultaneous decisions, it\\u0026#x27;s up to them to decide to help (or not) the other players (even if it\\u0026#x27;s a short term and blind cooperation) depending on whether the expected benefit is higher than the expected cost.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cbr/\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCreative writing and fictional worlds\\u003c/strong\\u003e are a game\\u0026#x27;s essential components. With your own words (not fake ones), you should try first to reach the hearts of smart people. If you want players to jump into your world, do your best by honing your vision and your narrative. I came from a world where gaming was not just about consumption but seen as an alternative way to define your identity. Words are still powerful for those who care about details. Therefore don\\u0026#x27;t give up when you will need to transpose your words into visual contents. Immersive experience happens when a player fully accepts to open himself into the game. This step is about connecting the imagination of perfect strangers. For my part, I always had a taste for futuristic world.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cbr/\\u003eIn every aspect, the game I\\u0026#x27;m designing respects these four criteria.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"image-container\\\"\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"https://hackernoon.com/photos/3CjwKRRSBRZDfkIKuZmqWkFMJKQ2-qb2x3ho1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"/\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003eThis post also gives me the opportunity to share few simple advice on how you could start from scratch :\\u003cbr/\\u003eTake a blank sheet and think of your game\\u0026#x27;s basics: state your game\\u0026#x27;s goal, define a space (boardgame, map, etc.), think about your objects (cards, scoreboards, characters etc.) and the role and actions of/and between each player.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cbr/\\u003eDon\\u0026#x27;t hesitate to write down all your ideas (even the silly ones), because our memory is so weak.

At every stage of your game\\u0026#x27;s design, you should wear a new pair of glasses. And you should ask yourself the following question: is this rule that I like so much still necessary if the player does that move? Every time you add a new rule you will have to think about the implications on the other rules. Every change has an impact somewhere. Explaining your set of rules to someone is not easy. Try different ways.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cbr/\\u003eOnce you have set your game\\u0026#x27;s rules, I only have one advice: make a prototype (do not care if it\\u0026#x27;s an ugly one, every small steps counts so much) and test it with some friends, test it with your family, test it with anyone until you get bored! And then, test it again and listen carefully to the player\\u0026#x27;s feedback.\\u003c/div\\u003e\\u003cdiv class=\\\"paragraph\\\"\\u003e\\u003cbr/\\u003eFinally, here is the one billion dollars question: how to create a great game? I really don\\u0026#x27;t know. Among others, I\\u0026#x27;m always surprised when people start answering to that by listing words like frustration, reward system and addiction. I don\\u0026#x27;t deny that there is some truth to that, but let\\u0026#x27;s hope we have succeeded here to dig deeper.
